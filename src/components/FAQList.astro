const common = [
  { q: "Does the kit support RNA activities?", a: "Yes. Uracil pieces are included for A–U pairing and single‑strand activities." },
  { q: "Is there a teachers’ guide?", a: "Yes. Downloadable lesson plans, worksheets, and answer guides are included." },
  { q: "What age range is this for?", a: "Recommended for ages 10+ (small parts). Perfect for middle to high-school biology." },

  {
    title: "Kit & Activities",
    items: [
      { q: "What’s the difference between DNA and RNA in the kit?", a: "DNA uses thymine (T) while RNA uses uracil (U). The kit includes both, so you can swap T→U to model transcription." },
      { q: "Do the colours have specific meanings?", a: "Yes. Bases are colour‑coded (A, T, C, G, U, 5‑mC) and connect to the beige backbone via orange phosphate links." },
      ...common,
      { q: "How many students can use one kit?", a: "One kit works well for pairs or small groups (2–4 students). Multiple kits scale to larger classes." },
      { q: "Is any wet lab work required?", a: "No. This is a clean, dry, 3‑D model designed purely for conceptual learning." },
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Ordering & Pricing",
    items: [
      { q: "Do you offer educator pricing?", a: "Yes. Classroom bundles and educator pricing are available—contact us and we’ll tailor a quote." },
      { q: "Can you work with purchase orders (POs) or W‑9s?", a: "Yes. We can provide a W‑9 and accept POs from schools and districts." },
      { q: "Do you sell replacement pieces?", a: "Yes. Contact us for small replacement packs (bases, backbones, jigs)." },
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Shipping & Materials",
    items: [
      { q: "How fast is shipping?", a: "Small batches ship quickly; larger classroom sets may require additional lead time." },
      { q: "What are the materials?", a: "Pieces are 3D‑printed in durable PLA; colours are chosen for clarity and contrast." },
      { q: "Is the kit washable?", a: "Yes. Wipe clean with mild soap and water; avoid high heat that can warp PLA." },
