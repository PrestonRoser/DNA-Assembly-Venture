    <p class="kicker">Our purpose</p>
    <h1 class="h1">Access, accuracy, and joy in learning biology.</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      We design classroom‑ready kits that make abstract genetics feel obvious. Our goal is simple:
      help more students “get it” — and help teachers save prep time — without premium price tags.

        <h2 class="h2">Principles</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Education first:</strong> Designed with teachers, not just for them.</li>
          <li><strong>Accuracy matters:</strong> Base‑pairing, antiparallel strands, 5′→3′ direction are built into the parts.</li>
          <li><strong>Access & affordability:</strong> Keep costs low so more classrooms can participate.</li>
          <li><strong>Small prep, big payoff:</strong> Materials you can open, explain, and run — the same day.</li>
          <li><strong>Iterate with classrooms:</strong> Feedback loops from pilots guide each revision.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">How we work</h2>
        <p>
          We co‑develop with educators: quick interviews, short pilots, and measurable outcomes.
          When something slows a lesson, we change it. When a step confuses students, we simplify the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each kit includes teacher guides, worksheets, and answer keys — aligned to core biology concepts and ready to print.
