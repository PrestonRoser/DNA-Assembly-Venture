      <p>
        We intend to reinvent education through tactile learning, something that shaped our own academic journeys.
        We aim to re instill the spark of curiosity that comes from building, testing, and exploring with your hands.
        Our mission is to reach classrooms across the United States, giving students a foundation for discovery,
        creativity, and lifelong problem solving, all while keeping our footprint sustainable.
