    <details class="card"><summary>What’s the difference between DNA and RNA in the kit?</summary>
      <p>DNA uses thymine (T) while RNA uses uracil (U). The kit includes both, so you can swap T→U to model transcription.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="card" style="margin-top:.75rem"><summary>Do the colours have specific meanings?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Bases are colour‑coded (A, T, C, G, U, 5‑mC) and connect to the beige backbone via orange phosphate links.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="card" style="margin-top:.75rem"><summary>How many students can use one kit?</summary>
      <p>One kit works well for pairs or small groups (2–4 students). Multiple kits scale to larger classes.</p>
