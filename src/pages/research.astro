    <h1 class="h1">Why hands-on learning works in STEM</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Research across K–16 shows that active, tactile learning improves performance,
      deepens understanding, and boosts engagement. This page synthesizes findings
      from peer-reviewed studies and national reports to explain why hands-on tools
      matter and how they inform the Hands kit design.

    <!-- Where to start in biology -->
    <section class="section" style="padding-top:0">
      <h2 class="h2">Why start with biology</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Biology reaches nearly all U.S. high school students, making it the broadest
        entry point for hands-on STEM. Focusing first on DNA to RNA to protein maximizes
        relevance while aligning to widely taught standards.
